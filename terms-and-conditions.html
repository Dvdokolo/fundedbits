  <br>
 <br>
  11.2. Know Your Customer (KYC):
  The objectives of Know Your Customer (KYC) procedures are:

 <br>11.3. Customer Due Diligence (CDD):
 <br>CDD is a mandatory process for initiating and maintaining engagements with counterparties. The CDD protocol mandates:
  <br>

  <br>
  <br> 11.4. Enhanced Due Diligence (EDD):

  <br>
 
  <br> 11.4.1. Obtaining additional identity verification documents, particularly in cases where standard documentation has been shown to be insufficient or questionable.
  <br>11.4.2. Conducting a detailed interview, which may include a video call, to interact face to face with the counterparty and better assess their legitimacy.

  <br>11.5.1. Verifying the identity of the counterparty based on original or duly certified documents after the dispute steps have been successfully completed. The KYC verification process will be initiated first.
  <br>11.5.2. When starting the verification, the counterparty will be screened via two options: scanning a QR code or receiving a verification link via SMS. The counterparty will receive instructions after choosing the convenient option.
  <br>11.5.3. The counterparty will be asked to submit specific documents. The documents may include a valid photo ID, for example:
  <br>– National ID card.
  <br>– Passport.
  <br>– Driving license.
  <br> 11.5.4. KYC verification will not be completed if expired documents are provided. Only the most recent and valid documents will be accepted to proceed with the verification process.
  <br>11.5.5. After collecting the necessary documents, the counterparty will be directed to the “Sign the agreement” stage. He/she must provide his/her full name and address and agree to the terms mentioned in the agreement. After these steps, the verification process will begin, which may take 48-72 hours.
  <br>11.5.6. The provider requires strict compliance with these measures. The Provider reserves the right to refuse or terminate any business engagement with a counterparty if the CDD, EDD or KYC criteria, as outlined herein, are not satisfactorily met.11.5.7. Please note that failure to pass the KYC verification process will result in the rejection of the counterparty’s Fundedbits payment request.

 <br>
 <br>
  
 <br>14.1. Client is prohibited from engaging in any trade that contravenes the provisions set forth in this section or in the FAQs or the rules or the Challenge Agreement. Any trade that violates these provisions is strictly prohibited. Client must abide by the rules and guidelines set forth in this section, as well as those set forth in the FAQs and the Challenge Agreement when using the Services.
 <br>
 <br>14.1.1. Client must not intentionally or unintentionally use trading strategies that exploit errors in the Services, such as inaccuracies in displayed prices or delays in their updates, including but not limited to practices commonly known as Latency Trading.
 <br>14.1.2. Client is prohibited from executing trades using an external or slow data feed or engaging in gap trading.
 <br>
 <br>14.1.3. Client is prohibited from engaging, alone or in collaboration with others, in any trade or combination of trades on connected accounts or accounts held within the platform, if the purpose is to manipulate trades, commonly referred to as “Group Trading”. Examples of such manipulation include taking opposing positions simultaneously.
 <br> 14.1.4. The use of any software, artificial intelligence, ultra-high-speed, high-frequency trading or mass data entry that could manipulate or abuse the systems or services of the Provider, or provide an unfair advantage, is prohibited to the Client.
 <br>14.1.5. The execution of arbitrage (of any kind), including but not limited to triangular arbitrage, statistical arbitrage, latency arbitrage, market making arbitrage, space arbitrage, pairs trading arbitrage, risk arbitrage, convertible arbitrage, volatility arbitrage, dividend arbitrage, tax arbitrage, yield curve arbitrage or any other form of arbitrage that may exploit price differences between different markets or exchanges, is prohibited to the Client.
 <br>14.1.6. The Client is prohibited from employing strategies that ensure the execution of limit orders during periods of low liquidity, as such practices do not reflect actual market conditions and therefore contravene the realistic trading simulation standards maintained by the Provider.
 <br>14.1.7. The Client is prohibited from executing trades that are not consistent with typical forex or any other financial market trades. They should also avoid any activity that may cause financial or other harm to the Provider, such as over-leverage, over-exposure, one-sided betting, grid trading, tick scalping or account rollovers. Engaging in any of these activities may raise valid concerns about intentional harm to the Provider.
 <br>14.1.8. Engaging in copy trading, where trades imitate or replicate the trading activities of other traders or entities without prior authorization from the Provider, is prohibited from the Client.
 <br>14.1.9. The Client, or any third party, is prohibited from participating in or collaborating with a third party to execute transactions for the Client, whether such third party is an individual or a professional, or from allowing a third party to access or execute transactions on its Fundedbits Challenge Account.
 <br>14.1.10. Accessing any third party Fundedbits Challenge Account, executing transactions on behalf of a third party or conducting any account management or similar service where the Client undertakes to execute transactions, manage or administer a Fundedbits Account on behalf of another user, whether professionally or otherwise, is prohibited to the Client.
 <br>14.1.11. Opening positions with a size significantly larger than the Client’s other transactions, whether in this account or in another of its accounts, is prohibited.
 <br>14.1.12. It is prohibited to open positions with numbers significantly lower or higher than the Client’s other trades, whether on this account or on another of its
 <br>14.1.13. The use of a high margin or an extremely risky trading strategy is prohibited to the Client.
 <br>
 <br>14.2. If the Client engages in any of the prohibited trading practices described in Clause 14.1, the Provider may:
 <br>14.2.1. Treat this as a failure to comply with the terms of the relevant Challenge provided by the Provider.
 <br> 14.2.2. Remove the prohibited transactions from the Client’s trading history and/or exclude their results from the profits and/or losses generated by Demo Trading.
 <br>14.2.3. Terminate all Services provided to the Client and subsequently terminate this Agreement.
 <br>
 <br>14.3. If any or all of the Prohibited Trading Practices are performed on one or more of a Client’s Fundedbits Challenge Accounts or on different Clients’ accounts, or by combining trading through Fundedbits Challenge Accounts and any Fundedbits Accounts, the Provider shall have the right to cancel all Services and terminate all relevant agreements in relation to all of the Client’s Fundedbits Challenge Accounts. The Provider may take any action set out in Section 14.2 and this Section 14.3 at its sole discretion.
 <br>
 <br>14.4. If the Provider’s Trader Accounts are used or engaged in any Prohibited Trading Practices, this may also constitute a breach of the respective terms and conditions for the Provider’s third party Trader Accounts and may result in the cancellation of all such user accounts and termination of their respective agreements by the third party provider.
 <br>
 <br>14.5. If the Client repeatedly engages in any of the practices described in Article 14.1 and the Provider has previously informed the Client of this, the Provider may deny the Client access to all or part of the Services, including access to the Dashboard and the Trading Platform, without compensation. In such case, the Client shall not be entitled to a refund of the fees paid.
 <br>
 <br>14.6. The Provider assumes no liability for trading or other investment activities that the Client carries out outside the relationship with the Provider, for example by using data or other information from the Client Portal, the trading platform or in any other way in connection with real trading services on the financial markets, even if the Client uses the same trading platform for such trading as it uses for demo trading. This applies in particular also to all third-party services that the Client uses via the platform.
  
  <br>
  <br>
  <span class="font-bold">Section 15 – Limitation of Liability; Disclaimer of Warranties</span>
  <br>
  <br>
  
  <br> Provider does not promise, represent or warrant that Customer’s use of the service will be error-free, timely, secure or uninterrupted. Provider does not warrant that the results obtained from the use of the service will be accurate or reliable. Customer acknowledges that Provider may suspend the service for indefinite periods or cancel the service at any time, with or without notice to Customer. Customer expressly agrees that its use of, or inability to use, the service is at its sole risk.
  <br> 
  <br>The Fundedbits Funded Demo Account does not represent a LIVE or REAL trading environment. Any Customer who reaches the Funded stage of any type of Simulated Fundedbits Challenge will have the opportunity to work on a special Fundedbits Account where, if Customer meets the essential Fundedbits characteristics, Customer will receive compensation based on a percentage of the simulated profit obtained from the initial account balance. Since the Client ALWAYS trades in a demo trading environment, no real profit will ever be made by any client and any possible payment due to the client, after reaching eligibility in a master phase, is at the discretion of Fundedbits.
  <br> 
  <br> The service and all products and services provided to the Client through the Provider service are provided “as is” and “as available” for the Client’s use, without any representation, warranty or condition of any kind, either express or implied, including all implied warranties or conditions of merchantability, merchantable quality, fitness for a particular purpose, durability, title and non-infringement.

Because some states or jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or the limitation of liability for consequential or incidental damages, in such states or jurisdictions, the liability of the Supplier shall be limited to the maximum extent permitted by law.
  
 <br>
 <br>
  <span class="font-bold"> Section 16 – Indemnity</span>
 <br>
 <br>
  
  Customer agrees to indemnify, defend and hold harmless Provider, together with its parent, subsidiaries, affiliates, partners, officers, directors, agents, contractors, licensors, service providers, subcontractors, suppliers, interns and employees, harmless from any claim or demand, including reasonable attorneys’ fees, made by any third-party due to or arising out of Customer’s breach of these Terms of Service, the documents they incorporate by reference, or Customer’s violation of any law or the rights of a third-party.
  
<br>
<br>
  <span class="font-bold">  Section 17 – Severability</span>
<br>
<br>
  
  If any provision of these Terms of Service is held to be unlawful, void or unenforceable, that provision will be enforceable to the fullest extent permitted by law. The unenforceable portion will be deemed severed from these Terms of Service, without affecting the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions.

  <br>
  <span class="font-bold">Section 18- Prohibited trading practices</span>
  <br>

  <br> Any Use Of Delayed Data Feeds For Risk-Free Profit

  <br>This may cause the account to be closed or, in the event of a one-off occurrence, the Payout mismatch at the time of the request! 
  
  <br>SOFT/HARD breach: 
  
  <br>In the case of a soft breach a challenge of half the initial size will be returned.
